            <strong>How we order your search results</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            There are many travel options available through our Service and we
            want to make your search results as relevant as possible. At the
            search results page you can select how to sort your results and use
            filter options to prioritise results based on your chosen
            preferences, for example price, guest review score, or other
            criteria. If you decide not to use these features, then you will see
            our default sort order.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within your search results we also sometimes display travel options
            that are paid-for commercial listings from our Travel Providers.
            Such travel options are clearly labelled for your information as
            “Ad” or similar equivalent labelling, to differentiate them from
            other travel options.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Redirection and third-party booking services</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are redirected from our Service to a third-party booking
            service to make a travel booking, please bear in mind that any
            bookings made through such a booking service will be with the
            third-party and not with us. We are not responsible for bookings
            made through third-party booking services and we have no liability
            to you in respect of such a booking. The terms and conditions of the
            third-party service provider will set out what rights you have
            against them and will explain their liability to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Section 3 Confirming a booking</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Your Booking Confirmation includes the essential elements of your
            booking, such as the description of the Travel Service(s) booked and
            the price.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will send your Booking Confirmation and any relevant travel
            documents to the email address you provide when you book. If you do
            not receive your Booking Confirmation within 24 hours of making your
            booking, please contact us.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Section 4 Payment</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Price</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            The price of the Travel Service(s) will be as displayed on our
            Service, except in cases of obvious error.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prices for Travel Services are dynamic and can change at any time.
            Price changes will not affect bookings already accepted, except in
            cases of obvious error. We display many Travel Services, and we try
            hard to ensure that the displayed price is accurate. We reserve the
            right to correct any pricing errors on our Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there is an obvious error and you have made a booking, we will
            offer you the opportunity to keep your booking by paying the correct
            price or we will cancel your booking without penalty. We have no
            obligation to make available Travel Services to you at an incorrect
            (lower) price even after you have been sent a Booking Confirmation,
            if the error should reasonably have been apparent to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Taxes</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            The prices displayed through our Service may include taxes or tax
            recovery charges. Such taxes or tax recovery charges may include
            amounts associated with value-added tax, goods and services tax,
            sales tax, occupancy tax and other taxes of a similar nature.
          </p>

          <p>
            You acknowledge that except as provided below with respect to tax
            obligations on the amounts received from you, including facilitation
            fees and service fees where applicable in accordance with Section 6
            (Stays) below, our Group of Companies does not collect taxes for
            remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax recovery
            charges on Pay Now bookings are a recovery of the estimated taxes
            that our Group of Companies pay to the Travel Provider for taxes due
            on the services provided by the Travel Provider (such as for the
            rental rate for the room). The Travel Providers are responsible for
            remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions.
            Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by
            jurisdiction. The actual amounts paid by our Group of Companies to
            the Travel Providers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts,
            depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of
            the actual use of the services provided by the Travel Provider.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sales, use and/or local hotel occupancy taxes are imposed on the
            amounts that our Group of Companies charge for services they provide
            (service fee and/or facilitation fee) in certain jurisdictions. The
            actual amount imposed on services provided by our Group of Companies
            may vary depending on the rates in effect at the time the services
            are provided by the Travel Provider. In certain jurisdictions, our
            Group of Companies are responsible for collecting and remitting
            sales, use and/or local hotel occupancy taxes for the entire price,
            including the amounts we charge for our services as well as the
            Travel Services provided by the Travel Provider.
          </p>

          <p>
            In certain jurisdictions, you may be responsible for paying local
            taxes imposed by local tax authorities (such as city taxes or
            tourist taxes, etc.). Our Group of Companies or the Travel Provider
            may charge you such local taxes. Our Group of Companies will notify
            you of any local taxes that will be payable by you before you
            complete your booking, where such taxes have been notified to our
            Group of Companies by the Travel Provider.
          </p>
          <p>
            The amount of local taxes can change between the booking date and
            stay date. If taxes have changed by your stay date, you may be
            liable to pay taxes at the higher rate.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Payment processing</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            For certain Travel Services, such as a Package (as defined in
            Section 6 (Packages), payment may be charged by more than one party
            (as will be shown on your payment method statement), however the
            total amount charged will not exceed the total price of all the
            Travel Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            When payment is taken at the time of your booking and paid for in
            the local currency of our Service (as relevant), the company taking
            that payment (via third-party payment processors) and charging your
            payment method will be the company set out next to the relevant
            location of our Service in the table below.
          </p>

          <p>
            Notwithstanding the governing law and jurisdiction paragraph
            in Section 15 (General) of these Terms, where one of our companies
            (as set out in the table above) takes your payment (via third-party
            payment processors) and charges your payment method, the law
            governing that payment transaction will be the laws of the location
            of such company.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Stored payment information</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Our Privacy Statement provides information on how we use your
            payment and account information when you elect for us to store a
            credit or debit card or other payment method for future use.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Payment verification</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            You authorize the relevant company (as set out in the table above)
            or the Travel Provider to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              verify your payment method by obtaining a pre-authorization,
              charging a nominal fee or through other verification meanss, and
            </li>
            <li>on verification, charge your payment method.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Fees charged by banks</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Some banks and card issuers impose fees for international or
            cross-border transactions. For example, if you make a booking using
            a card issued in a different country from the Travel Provider’s
            location or you choose to transact in a currency that is different
            from the local currency of our Service, your card issuer may charge
            you an international or cross-border transaction fee.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, some banks and card issuers impose fees for currency
            conversion. For example, if you make a booking in a currency
            different to the currency of your credit card, your card issuer may
            convert the booking amount to the currency of your credit card and
            charge you a conversion fee.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate
            applied to your booking, please contact your bank or card issuer.
            Our Group of Companies is not associated or responsible for any fees
            relating to varying exchange rates and card issuer fees.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Alternative payment methods</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            We may partner with providers of alternative payment methods (such
            as consumer finance companies), to provide our travelers with
            alternative payment methods. Our Group of Companies does not endorse
            or recommend any alternative payment provider or their products or
            services. Our Group of Companies is not responsible for the content
            or the acts or omissions of any alternative payment provider. Your
            use of any such provider’s payment method is at your own risk and
            will be governed by such provider’s terms and policies.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Currency conversion</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Any currency conversion rates displayed on our Service are based on
            public sources and current exchange rates, which may vary at the
            time of travel. Such rates are provided for information purposes

            <strong>Fraud</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            If a booking or account shows signs of fraud, abuse, association
            with a government-sanctioned person or entity, or other suspicious
            activity, we may request extra information from you.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we reasonably conclude that a booking or account is associated
            with fraud or suspicious activity, we may:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              cancel any bookings associated with your name, email address or
              account
            </li>
            <li>close any associated accounts, and</li>
            <li>
              take legal action, including to seek to hold you liable for any
              loss.

            <strong>Section 5 Cancelling or changing a booking</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cancellation or change by you</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Cancellations or changes (with respect to the travel date,
            destination, place where the trip starts, property or means of
            transport) to a booking can be made by contacting us.
          </p>
          <p>
            You do not have an automatic right to cancel or change a booking
            unless allowed by the relevant Travel Provider under their Rules and
            Restrictions (which are provided to you before you make a booking).
          </p>

          <p>
            Travel Providers may charge you fees for cancelling (in full or
            part) or changing a booking. Such fees will be set out in the Rules
            and Restrictions. You agree to pay any charges that you incur.
            Please be aware that for changes, the price of your new arrangements
            will be based on the applicable price at the time you ask us to make
            the change. This price may not be the same as when you originally
            booked the Travel Services. Prices tend to increase the closer to
            the departure date that the change is made.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please read the relevant Rules and Restrictions, so you know which
            terms apply to your booking. For example:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              if you book a stay at a property and you do not cancel or change
              your booking before the relevant cancellation policy period, you
              may be subject to the cancellation or change charges as shown in
              the relevant Rules and Restrictions
            </li>
            <li>
              some properties do not permit cancellations of, or changes to,
              bookings after they are made
            </li>
            <li>
              if you make a Pay Later booking and you do not show up or cancel
              the booking, the property may impose a no-show or cancellation
              charge as shown in the relevant Rules and Restrictions and you
              will be charged the property's no-show or cancellation charge in
              the property's local currency
            </li>
            <li>
              if you do not show up or fail to use some or all of the Travel
              Services booked, refunds may only be due to you in line with the
              relevant Rules and Restrictions, and
            </li>
            <li>
              where a cancellation affects more than one person on a booking
              (for example, two airline tickets booked on a single itinerary,
              etc.), any applicable cancellation charge will be applied in
              respect of each person on the cancelled booking.
              <br />
              <br />
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you want to cancel or change any part of a booking and such
            cancellation or change is allowed by the relevant Travel Provider,
            then, in addition to any charges imposed by the Travel Provider, we
            may also charge you an administration fee. If such an administration
            fee applies, it will be notified to you before you agree to proceed
            with the change/cancellation.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Other cancellation or change</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            We (and the relevant Travel Provider) may cancel your booking if
            full payment for the booking, or any applicable cancellation/change
            charge or fee relating to a booking is not received when due.
          </p>

          <p>
            For a variety of reasons (such as a property is overbooked due to
            connectivity issues or a property is closed due to a hurricane,
            etc.), it is possible that a booking may be cancelled or changed by
            the Travel Provider or us. If this happens, we will make reasonable
            efforts to notify you as soon as possible, and offer alternative
            options/assistance or a refund where possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Refund</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Any refunds will be transferred back to you to the payment method
            you used to make the original booking. Such refunds will be made by
            the party that took your original payment. Our fees are not
            refundable unless this is stated otherwise during the booking
            process.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Section 6 Travel Service specific terms</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            This Section provides details of the terms relevant to the specific
            Travel Services provided by the Travel Provider. These details are
            not exhaustive and do not replace the relevant Rules and
            Restrictions, which are provided to you before you make a booking.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each Travel Service may be offered separately or as part of a
            Package (as defined in Section 6 (Packages) and is subject to the
            relevant Rules and Restrictions of the Travel Provider. Please also
            read this Section which will also apply to your booking as
            applicable. If there is any inconsistency between this Section and
            the relevant Rules and Restrictions, the relevant Rules and
            Restrictions prevail.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Stays</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Our Service may provide you with the option to Pay Now or Pay Later.
            Room rates (including any applicable taxes and fees) are displayed
            to you through our Service under the Pay Now and Pay Later payment
            options. Please note that taxes and fees may vary depending on which
            payment option you choose. Tax rates and foreign exchange rates may
            change in the time between booking and your stay.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Pay Now</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            If you select the Pay Now payment option, the relevant company (as
            set out in Section 4 (Payment)) typically will charge the booking
            amount to your payment method on booking.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our Group of Companies facilitate bookings made available through
            our Service. You acknowledge that our Group of Companies facilitate
            such bookings for a consideration (the “facilitation fee”). The room
            rate displayed through our Service is a combination of the amount
            charged by the Travel Provider (for their services for the rental of
            the room) and the facilitation fee (charged and retained by our
            Group of Companies). Our Group of Companies may also charge and
            retain additional separate service fees in servicing your booking,
            which may vary based on the amount and type of booking.
          </p>

          <p>
            You agree that your payment method will be charged by our Group of
            Companies for the total booking amount, which includes the room rate
            displayed through our Service, plus tax recovery charges and service
            fees or, where applicable, taxes on the room rate and/or services
            provided by our Group of Companies. On making your booking request
            you authorize our Group of Companies to facilitate the booking on
            your behalf, including making payment arrangements with Travel
            Providers.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Pay Later</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            If you select the Pay Later payment option, the Travel Provider will
            charge your payment method in the local currency at the time of your
            stay.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Deposit</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Some stay Travel Providers require a payment card or cash deposit at
            check-in to cover extra expenses incurred during your stay. Such
            deposit is not related to any payment received by the relevant
            company (as set out in Section 4 (Payment)) for your booking.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>First night no-show</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            If you do not show for the first night of your stay booking, but
            plan to check in for the subsequent nights, please confirm this with
            us before the original check-in date. If you do not confirm this,
            then your whole booking may be cancelled. Refunds for no-show will
            only be due to you in line with the relevant Rules and Restrictions
            of the property.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Group bookings</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            You may not book more than 8 rooms through our Service for the same
            property for the same stay dates. If you book more than 8 rooms in
            separate bookings, we may cancel your bookings. We may also charge
            you a cancellation fee and if you paid a non-refundable deposit,
            such deposit may be forfeited. If you want to book more than 8 rooms
            then please book through the “Groups and Meetings” section via our
            Service. You may be asked to sign a written contract or pay a
            non-refundable deposit.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ratings</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Ratings shown through our Service indicate what you might expect
            from properties displaying that rating level, including (where
            applicable) through local and national star rating organizations.
            These may differ from standards in your own country. Site displayed
            ratings do not represent or promise any particular feature or
            amenity. Additional information is available in the “Overview” or
            “Amenities” section of the property details page. These guidelines
            are subject to change, and our Group of Companies and our Partners
            cannot guarantee the accuracy of any specific rating displayed from
            time to time through our Service.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Meals</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            If meals are part of your stay booking, the number of meals included
            depends on the number of nights of your stay. Full board normally
            includes breakfast, lunch and dinner. Half board normally includes
            breakfast and either lunch or dinner. No refunds will be available
            if one or more meals are not consumed.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Flights</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            If you pay our Group of Companies (on behalf of the Travel Provider)
            for a standalone flight booking, we will act as agent of such Travel
            Provider. Your contract for the flight is between you and the
            relevant Travel Provider.
          </p>

          <p>
            The price and availability of your flight is only guaranteed once
            your purchase of the Travel Service is completed and your tickets
            issued.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Low-cost flights</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            For certain flights, the price displayed may have been converted
            from another currency. This is for convenience purposes to provide
            you an estimated price in your local currency. The actual amount
            charged by the airline may differ due to varying exchange rates
            applied by banks and card issuing companies. Please see Section 4
            (Payment) for information on fees that may be charged by banks and
            card issuers.
            <br />

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Site redirection</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Sometimes you may be redirected from our Service to the airline's
            website to complete your booking and pay. Your contract for any such
            booking is with the relevant airline Travel Provider. Our Group of
            Companies is not associated with, or liable in respect of, any such
            bookings.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Flight terms and conditions</strong>
          </p>

          <p>You understand and agree that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              airlines ultimately control their schedules, and they may change
              or cancel your flight for a variety of reasons (for example,
              mechanical problems or adverse weather, etc.). Whenever the
              airline gives us information about a change or cancellation to
              your itinerary, we will pass it on to you and help you assess your
              options. You should always check the scheduled departure time of
              your flight before travel
            </li>
            <li>
              airlines control seating and we do not guarantee the availability
              of specific seats, even when pre-booked
            </li>
            <li>
              if you book a return flight and do not use the outward flight, the
              airline may cancel the return flight without refund
            </li>
            <li>
              for special or charter flights, the airline, the flight schedule,
              the aircraft type, the itinerary and possible stops are given as
              an indication only. These specifics may be subject to change even
              after confirmation
            </li>
            <li>
              some airlines impose extra charges for meals, luggage and
              preferred seat selection, etc. Unless we provide such optional
              services for booking through our Service then any reference about
              these extra optional services and related charges shown through
              our Service is for information only and may be updated by airlines
              at any time. Where we provide the option for you to book such
              extras through our Service, then the price of such optional extras
              will be displayed to you and after selection by you, added to your
              price
            </li>
            <li>
              you must follow the relevant Rules and Restrictions on the
              carriage of children. Children older than 2 on the return date
              must have a return ticket at a child fare for both the outbound
              and inbound flights. You will not be eligible for a refund of any
              seat charges incurred during travel if you do not comply. Children
              aged under 2 will not be allocated their own seat unless a child
              fare is booked for them. Unaccompanied children under 14 will only
              be allowed to fly in line with the relevant Rules and Restrictions
            </li>
            <li>
              the carriage of hazardous materials aboard aircraft in your
              luggage or on you is generally forbidden.
              <br />

              Combined one-way tickets

            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We may offer you the opportunity to book two one-way tickets instead
            of a roundtrip ticket. Combined one-way tickets may provide a
            greater choice of flights. They are often cheaper and can be
            combined on the same airline or on different airlines.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unlike roundtrip tickets, each one-way ticket is subject to its own
            Rules and Restrictions. If one of these flights is affected by an
            airline change (such as cancellation or rescheduling), then you may
            have to make changes to the other flight. In such instances you will
            be responsible for any charges or fees incurred for making changes
            to the unaffected flight.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Air miles and vouchers</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Air miles and vouchers from loyalty programs may not be used when
            booking flights through our Service.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Airline liability</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Law, treaties and the airline's own Rules and Restrictions normally
            limit an airline's liability for death, personal injury and other
            damages.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Operating airlines</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Flights booked with one airline are sometimes operated by another
            airline. When different, details of the operating airline are shown
            through our Service. The airline that issues your ticket will charge
            you for your flight and will appear on your payment method
            statement.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>No-show or cancellation</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            In case of a no-show or cancellation, you may be entitled to a

            <strong>Payment</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            For certain bookings, payment for your car rental booking may be
            charged by the Travel Provider, not our Group of Companies.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you collect your rental car, you/the driver must present
            your/their valid credit card. You must check with the Travel
            Provider which credit cards they accept. Debit cards are not
            accepted. The Travel Provider may submit an authorization request to
            your credit card issuer during the rental period by way of a
            deposit. You/the driver should ensure you have a sufficient credit
            limit for this purpose. Some larger car types may require two credit
            cards.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you do not follow the above rules, the Travel Provider may not
            make the vehicle available to you and you may, subject to the Rules
            and Restrictions, be required to pay an amount up to the full price
            of car rental Travel Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Supplements</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Extra charges may be payable by you locally to the Travel Provider.
            For example, these charges may cover refuelling, snow tyres,
            additional driver charges, young driver surcharges, child seats and
            delivery and collection fees, etc. We and the Travel Provider are
            not responsible for paying such extra charges.
          </p>

          <p>
            An insurance excess amount may be applicable in the event of theft
            of, or damage to, the rental car and payable by you to the Travel
            Provider. This will vary depending on the Travel Provider and rental
            country. Purchase of optional extra insurance coverage by you
            locally can remove/reduce the applicable excess. We and the Travel
            Provider are not responsible for any excess payable or the provision
            of extra insurance coverage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fuel is not usually included in the rental price. In some countries,
            some Travel Providers may charge you for refuelling when the vehicle
            is returned. Unless agreed otherwise, you must return the rental car
            to the same branch of the Travel Provider from which it was
            collected.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Collection and use of rental cars</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Drivers must usually be aged between 21 and 75, although this can
            vary depending on the relevant Travel Provider and rental country.
            You are responsible for checking this with the Travel Provider.
            Extra charges may apply if a driver is aged below 25 or over 70.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you collect your rental car, you/the driver must present
            your/their full valid driving licence for the category of vehicle
            rented. International rentals may have different driving licence
            requirements. Please check what exact documentation is required by
            the Travel Provider. For example, if the drivers' licence is not in
            the Roman alphabet, an international driving licence is required.
            Extra documentation, such as a passport or up to two forms of proof
            of name and address, may also be required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically, you will not be permitted to take your rental car outside
            of the rental country, or on ferries, and additional restrictions
            may apply.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Cancellation of bookings and unused rental days</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            No refunds will be offered on bookings cancelled within 6 hours of
            collection time or for any unused rental days.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Cruises</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Some Travel Providers offering cruises may require you to sign their
            liability waiver prior to participating in the Travel Service they
            offer.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Things to do/activities</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Some Travel Providers offering Things to do may require you to sign
            their liability waiver prior to participating in the Travel Service
            they offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Things to do Travel Services are not usually transferable nor
            eligible for refunds or changes unless the Travel Provider cancels
            such Travel Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Packages</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            We provide the opportunity for you to book separate Travel Services
            together at the same time through our Service (for example, a stay
            booking and a flight booking) but each Travel Service is subject to
            its own Rules and Restrictions and these Terms (such a combined
            booking is a “Package”).

          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>International travel</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Although most travel occurs without incident, travel to certain
            destinations may involve more risk than others. You must review any
            travel warnings/advice, etc. issued by the relevant governments
            before you book international travel. You should also monitor such
            travel warnings/advice during travel and before your return journey
            to help avoid and minimise any potential disruptions.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Health</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Recommended inoculations/vaccinations may change at any time. You
            should consult your doctor on current recommendations before you
            depart. You are responsible for ensuring you:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>meet all health entry requirements</li>
            <li>receive the recommended inoculations/vaccinations</li>
            <li>take all recommended medication, and</li>
            <li>follow all medical advice in relation to your travel.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Passport and visa</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            You must consult the relevant Embassy or Consulate for passport and
            visa information. Requirements may change so check for up-to-date
            information before booking and departure and allow sufficient time
            for all relevant applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our Group of Companies is not liable if you are refused entry onto a
            flight or into any country, due to your conduct, including your
            failure to carry the correct and adequate travel documents required
            by any Travel Provider, authority or country (including countries
            you are transiting through). This includes all stops made by an
            aircraft, even if you do not leave the aircraft or airport.
          </p>

          <p>
            Several governments are introducing new requirements for airlines to
            provide personal information about all travelers on their aircraft.
            The data will be collected either at the airport when you check in
            or in some circumstances when you make your booking. Please contact
            the relevant airline you are travelling with if you have any
            questions about this.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our Group of Companies does not represent or warrant that travel to
            international destinations is advisable or without risk and is not
            liable for damages or losses that may result from travel to such
            destinations.

            The Travel Providers provide us with information describing the

            The display of Travel Services through our Service is not an

            If our Group of Companies or our Partners are found liable for any

          <ul>
            <li>

            greater of (a) the cost paid by you for the Travel Services in
            question or (b) one-hundred dollars (US$100.00) or the equivalent in
            local currency.
          </p>

          <p>
            This limitation of liability reflects the allocation of risk between
            you and us. The limitations specified in this Section will survive
            and apply even if any limited remedy specified in these Terms is
            found to have failed its essential purpose. The limitations of

            Every instance of force majeure, including the interruption of means
            of communication or a strike by airlines, properties or air traffic
            controllers, will lead to the suspension of the obligations in these
            Terms that are affected by the force majeure event. In such a case
            the party affected by the force majeure event will not be liable as
            a result of the inability to meet such obligations.

            <strong>Disputes and arbitration</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Please read this Section carefully. It requires that any and all
            claims be resolved by binding arbitration or in small claims court,
            and it prevents you from pursuing a class action or similar
            proceeding in any forum. Arbitration is required if your country of
            residence enforces arbitration agreements, including without
            limitation, the United States. If you are outside the United States
            but attempt to bring a claim in the United States, arbitration is
            required for determination of the threshold issue of whether this
            dispute resolution section applies to you, as well as all other
            threshold determinations, including residency, arbitrability, venue,
            and applicable law. If your country of residence does not enforce
            arbitration agreements, the mandatory pre-arbitration dispute
            resolution and notification and prohibition on class actions or
            representative proceedings provided below still apply to the extent
            enforceable by law.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are committed to traveler satisfaction and to resolving consumer
            disputes in a timely and efficient manner. We have a two-step
            dispute resolution process that includes: (1) investigation and
            negotiation of your claim with our Traveler Support team; and, if
            necessary, (2) binding arbitration administered by the American
            Arbitration Association (“AAA”) or, for arbitrations outside of the
            United States, an agreed upon arbitral tribunal. You and us each
            retain the right to seek relief in small claims court as an
            alternative to arbitration.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”)</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              You and we mutually agree that any disputes between us arising out
              of or relating in any way to our Service, these Terms, our Privacy
              Statement, any services or products provided by us or any of our
              subsidiaries, Travel Providers, or companies offering products or
              services through us, any dealings with our Traveler Support
              agents, or any representations made by us (“Claims”), will be
              resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court except those
              resolved in small claims court. This includes any Claims you
              assert against us, our subsidiaries, Travel Providers, or any
              companies offering products or services through us (which are
              beneficiaries of this Arbitration Agreement). This Arbitration
              Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall include any claims
              brought by or against, any third parties, including but not
              limited to your spouses, heirs, third-party beneficiaries, and
              assigns, where their underlying claims are in relation to your use
              of the Travel Services. To the extent that any third-party
              beneficiary to these Terms brings claims against the entities
              covered by these Terms; those claims shall also be subject to this
              Arbitration Agreement. The arbitrator shall also be responsible
              for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including
              without limitation the existence, scope, or validity of the
              Arbitration Agreement, any defense to arbitration such as issues
              relating to whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced, is
              unconscionable or illusory, and any defenses to arbitration,
              including without limitation jurisdiction, waiver, delay, laches,
              or estoppel.

            <strong>Small claims court matters</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, either you or
            we may bring, or remove, any claim in small claims court if the
            claim is within such court’s jurisdictional limit; provided that
            such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a
            class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims
            of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such
            proceeding. Further, if the claims asserted in any demand for
            arbitration is within the small claims court’s jurisdictional limit,
            then either you or us may elect to have the claims heard in small
            claims court, rather than in arbitration, at any time before the
            arbitrator is appointed, or in accord with the AAA rules, by
            notifying the other party of that election in writing.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>No class actions or representative proceedings</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            You and we agree that any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will
            be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class,
            consolidated, or representative action, including without limitation
            as a private attorney general. The arbitrator may not consolidate
            more than one party’s Claims and may not otherwise preside over any
            form of any class or representative proceeding. You and we further
            acknowledge that you are each waiving your right to a jury trial.
          </p>

            <strong>Entire agreement</strong>

            these Terms. No third-party's consent shall be required for the
